-- Hi there. ðŸŒŠ
--
-- If you're here to remove or modify StepManiaVersionIsSupported because the
-- StepMania version you use isn't supported â€“ I get where you're coming from.
--
-- It can be frustrating when you just want to play a free game and there seems
-- to be arbitrary walls up preventing that.  I get that that is what this
-- probably feels like.
--
-- For now, Simply Love supports SM5.0.12 and beta releases of SM5.1 from
-- the main StepMania project, which can be found on GitHub at
-- https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/
--
-- Other forks, older builds, other projects, etc. are blocked here, regardless
-- of their compatibility with Simply Love.  I am only one human person, and I've
-- taken on too much responsibility here with moving the post-ITG community forward
-- in a responsible, open, and inclusive manner.
--
-- I've done very little with my life that I am proud of, but I am confident that
-- this Simply Love project has helped dance game enthusiasts from all over the world
-- enjoy a silly arrow game together, as a community.
--
-- Regardless of their location or language, regardless of their access to specific
-- hardware with limited availability, almost anyone can install and use and benefit
-- from Simply Love.  This is a good thing, and I am proud of this.
--
-- Supporting this is not easy. It's almost always easier to do a quick fix that works
-- for one circumstance â€“ one particular machine, one particular hardware device, one
-- one particular community.  Writing code and designing software that accommodates the
-- broadest community is hard, but it's critically important.  It's the responsibility
-- I've gradually assumed over the years I've worked on Simply Love.
--
-- So, if you're here to remove of modify StepManiaVersionIsSupported as a quick fix,
-- I'll ask you to consider giving back to the broader community instead.
--
-- What features does your fork have that mainline StepMania doesn't?  Can they be
-- brought into mainline StepMania?  Maybe you don't know, maybe you're not a developer,
-- but maybe you know someone who does or is.  Ask.  Get things moving.  Contribute.
-- Everyone will be better off because you helped.
--
-- I appreciate your understanding.  Maybe we can share a dance in the future. :)
--

-- game types like "kickbox" and "lights" aren't supported in Simply Love, so we

-- (Because so many people have accidentally gotten themselves into lights mode without
-- having any idea they'd done so, and have then messaged me saying the theme was broken.)
