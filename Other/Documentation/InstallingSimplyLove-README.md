# Installing Simply Love

## 1. Delete Old Copies First

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Simply Love, fully delete the old Simply Love folder first.

**Do not merge the new folder into the old.**

ðŸ”· Reminder: If you added additional judgment graphics to your old copy of Simply Love, you'll want to back them up. You would have added them to `./Simply Love/Graphics/_judgments/` in the old theme, and that's where they'll go in the new theme.

## 2. Download

You can download the current Simply Love release at the **[Latest Release](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5/releases/latest)** page.

As of this writing, GitHub puts the download link at the bottom of the release page, under the **Assets** header.

GitHub also provides two separate downloads (zip and tag.gz) labeled "Source code" under Assets.  If you just want to download and use Simply Love, you can safely ignore those. ðŸ™‚

## 3. Unzip, Install

To install Simply Love, unzip it and move the resulting *Simply Love* folder into your [StepMania user content folder](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/User-Data-Locations).

If you're using **SM5.0.12**, Simply Love should be installed here:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows 10, Windows 7</td>
    <td>C:\Users\<code>USERNAME</code>\AppData\Roaming\StepMania 5\Themes\Simply Love\</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>macOS</td>
    <td>/Users/<code>USERNAME</code>/Library/Application Support/StepMania 5/Themes/Simply Love/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linux</td>
    <td>/home/<code>USERNAME</code>/.stepmania-5.0/Themes/Simply Love/</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Or, if you're using **SM5.1-beta**:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows 10, Windows 7</td>
    <td>C:\Users\<code>USERNAME</code>\AppData\Roaming\StepMania 5.1\Themes\Simply Love\</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>macOS</td>
    <td>/Users/<code>USERNAME</code>/Library/Application Support/StepMania 5.1/Themes/Simply Love/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linux</td>
    <td>/home/<code>USERNAME</code>/.stepmania-5.1/Themes/Simply Love/</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

ðŸ”· Tip: If you find yourself adding/modifying themes frequently, you may wish to create a shortcut as the user content folder can be inconvenient to navigate to.

## 4. Switch to Simply Love

The next time you use StepMania, you can switch to Simply Love from the main options menu found on the Title Screen.

The exact process can vary depending on your current theme, but this setting is usually in **Options â†’ Display Options â†’ Appearance Options â†’ Theme**

## Troubleshooting

If you switch to Simply Love and see a plain black screen with white text, you might have nested folders too deeply.

You might have `/Themes/Simply Love/Simply Love/` <br>
when you want &nbsp;`/Themes/Simply Love/`

This can happen when unzipping the download.

Quit StepMania, check to see if the theme's files are nested too deeply, and move the correct folder up a level if needed.
