[OptionExplanations]
# Top-level Service menu items
System Options=Change the game type, the theme, the language, and more.
Arcade Options=Change options typically associated with arcade games.
Visual Options=Change the way lyrics, backgrounds, etc. are displayed during gameplay; adjust overscan.
Appearance Options=Change the way things are displayed during gameplay (lyrics, backgrounds, etc.).
Theme Options=Adjust settings that only apply to this Simply Love theme.
USB Custom Songs Options=Adjust settings related to USB Custom Songs, including enabling or disabling the feature altogether.
MenuTimer Options=Turn the MenuTimer On or Off and set the MenuTimer values for various screens.
Input Options=Adjust input options such as joystick automapping, dedicated menu buttons, and input debounce.
Acknowledgments=View acknowledgments and credits for Simply Love, StepMania, and more.

# System Options
Game=Change the current game type.\n\n• dance is 4-panel (DDR and ITG).\n\n• pump is 5-panel (Pump It Up).\n\n• techno is 8-panel (TechnoMotion).\n\nOther game types (kickbox, para, beat, etc.) may not actually be supported.
Theme=Change the look and feel of StepMania.\n\nThemes often extend the base functionality of SM5 in unique ways.
Language=Choose your language.\n\nSimply Love officially supports English, French, and Español.\n\nOther languages have limited support in Simply Love, but may be better supported in other themes.
Announcer=Choose a gameplay announcer from this list of packs you have installed.
DefaultNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin to use when playing.\n\nThis can be changed by players if they wish in the Player Options menu prior to gameplay.
Editor Noteskin=Select the default noteskin for Edit Mode.

# Display/Sound Options
Set BG Fit Mode=Adjust how StepMania will display (scale, crop, etc.) backgrounds during gameplay.

#Graphics/Sound Options
SmoothLines=Toggle whether certain theme components are rendered with antialiased lines.\n\nSpecifically, any theme or simfile that utilizes an ActorMultiVertex in 'LineStrip' mode will be impacted by this setting.
FastNoteRendering=If enabled, the z buffer is not cleared after every note.  This causes 3D noteskins to collide, but substantially improves performance in gameplay.
VisualDelaySeconds=Subtract or add this many seconds of visual delay to gameplay.  This can be used to compensate for an LCD monitor/TV with a lot of "lag" or latency.\n\nIf you want to try values with decimal point precision, you will need to manually edit your Preferences.ini file.

# Appearance Options
ShowLyrics=Toggle the display of song lyrics during gameplay if they are available.\n\nLyrics can be provided on a per-song basis by using a .lrc file.
ShowBanners=Toggle the display of song banners during Select Music if they are available.
BGBrightness=Control how bright the background will appear during gameplay.\n\nLower values result in a darker background.  0% is completely black.
RandomBackgroundMode=• Off - Display the background specified by the song and nothing more.\n\n• Random Animations – Show randomly selected items from the BGAnimations folder during gameplay.\n\n• Random Movies - Show randomly selected items in the RandomMovies folder during gameplay.
NumBackgrounds=Choose the number of random backgrounds that will cycle per song.\n\nIf Random Gameplay Backgrounds is 'Off', this has no effect.
Center1Player=Turn this option 'On' to center the notefield during gameplay when only one player is active.


# Arcade Options
CoinMode=• Home - Options are shown on the Title screen.\n\n• Pay - Title screen choices are hidden; players must insert credits before playing. Pay mode is only possible when Event Mode is "Off."\n\n• Free Play - Title screen choices are hidden; no credits required to play.
NumberOfCoinsPerCredit=This determines how many coins are necessary for a single credit.
Long Time=This is the length at which a song counts as two rounds.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as two rounds.
Marathon Time=This is the length at which a song counts as three rounds.\n\nIf Songs Per Play is set to 2, any song that counts as three rounds will not appear as a choice.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as three rounds.
AllowMultipleHighScoreWithSameName=Set this to 'Off' to prevent a single player from dominating the high score list for a given song.  Each chart will only allow one of a given high score handle.\n\nSet this to 'On' if you own your machine and wish to track your own progress.
ComboContinuesBetweenSongs=If turned off, the combo will reset to 0 between each song.\n\nIf turned on, the combo will carry between songs (and between unique games if profiles are not in use, which is typically the case...).
Disqualification=If turned off, players cannot be disqualified from earning high scores.\n\nIf enabled, certain conditions (C-Mods on charts with speed changes, disabling attacks on charts with attacks, etc.) will disqualify players from earning high scores.
Premium=This setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.\n\n• 'Off' means one player can play with one credit\n\nThe remaining two options are surprisingly self-explanatory.

# Input Options
OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons=• Use Gameplay Buttons - Navigate through the game using your dance pad.\n\n• Only Dedicated Buttons - Navigate through the game using dedicated menu buttons, presumably on an arcade cabinet.\n\nPlease ensure your menu buttons are mapped before changing this setting, otherwise you might get stuck.
ThreeKeyNavigation=Enable this if you only have three MenuButtons per player (e.g. a traditional DDR arcade cabinet).  Some UI elements will change to reflect this.\n\nWith this enabled, you can save screenshots in Simply Love at Evaluation by simultaneously pressing\n&MENULEFT; and &MENURIGHT;.
ArcadeOptionsNavigation=This impacts how option menus are navigated.\n\n• StepMania Style - &START; button moves to end.\n\n• Arcade Style - &START; button moves to next option line.
InputDebounceTime=Time that a panel takes to de-press.  Use this to deal with ghost steps that occur a few milliseconds after a real step.
AxisFix=Workaround fix for some USB adapters that would otherwise map the D-Pad to Axis, preventing certain jump combinations from being possible.\n\nThis does not work on macOS or Linux's JS driver yet.
#'

# Simply Love Options
AutoStyle=Set this if you ALWAYS play a certain style and want to get to gameplay as fast as possible.\n\nSet this to "None" if you want to choose a style like "1 Player" or "2 Players" for each new game cycle.
DefaultGameMode=Set the starting position of the cursor when selecting a GameMode.\n\nNote that this does not skip the screen, it just changes the starting choice.
TimingWindowAdd=Apply this controversial setting at your own discretion.\n\nThe StomperZ and ECFA GameModes ignore this setting.
AllowFailingOutOfSet=If 'Yes' players can potentially fail out of a set early.  If 'No' players will always be able to play all their songs.\n\nThis has no impact in EventMode.
NumberOfContinuesAllowed=Allow players to chain multiple games together by entering extra credits. Set this to 0 if you want to disable it.\n\nThis feature only applies to Pay Mode, because credits only exist in Pay Mode.
MusicWheelSpeed=Change the speed at which the MusicWheel will scroll through content.\n\nA faster MusicWheel is especially helpful when the MenuTimer is enabled.

AllowScreenSelectProfile=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Profile screen.\n\nThe Select Profile screen can be helpful if you have multiple local profiles.
AllowScreenSelectColor=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Color screen.\n\nNote that Rainbow Mode disables the Select Color screen by default.
AllowScreenEvalSummary=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Evaluation Summary screen.
AllowScreenNameEntry=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Name Entry screen.\n\nThe Name Entry screen is always skipped in Casual mode, regardless of this setting.
AllowScreenGameOver=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Game Over screen.

MusicWheelStyle=Set this to 'IIDX' if you want the MusicWheel to hide other, inactive song groups when actively browsing one.
AllowDanceSolo=Set this to 'Yes' if you want to enable Solo style as a selectable option.\n\nThis only impacts 'Dance' game mode.
HideStockNoteSkins=Set this to 'Hide' if you want to hide all NoteSkins that come with SM5 from the modifier menu.

nice=This setting will search for instances of "69" on the Evaluation screen and let you know that they are "nice."

ShowGradesInMusicWheel=Show or hide letter grades for each song you've played within its MusicWheelItem.
CasualMaxMeter=Charts harder than this will be filtered out of Casual Mode.
VisualTheme=Choose the visual icon/emblem for this theme.
RainbowMode=Turn Rainbow Mode on or off.\n\nRainbow Mode disables ScreenSelectColor by default.
UseImageCache=Casual Mode will run more smoothly with the ImageCache system "On" but StepMania will use a LOT more RAM as a consequence. It is recommended that you have at least 8GB of RAM to use the ImageCache system.\n\nYou will need to restart StepMania after turning this setting on for it to take effect.
VerboseSongFolder=Turn Verbose Song Folder metadata on or off. Enabling this on will display the full folder name of a selected song. Sometimes song folders have relevant information in them. Turn this off to simply show the song group instead.

#'
# USB Profile CustomSongs Options
CustomSongsEnable=Allow custom songs to be loaded from USB profiles.\n\nNote that you must properly configure your OS to mount and recognize USB memory cards first for this to work.\n\nConsult the Wiki on StepMania's GitHub for Linux instructions or hackmycab.com for Windows instructions.
#'
CustomSongsMaxCount=Place an upper limit on the number of songs that will be loaded from a given USB profile.
CustomSongsLoadTimeout=If loading a custom song takes more seconds than this, give up.
CustomSongsMaxSeconds=If a custom song is longer than this many seconds, disable it.
CustomSongsMaxMegabytes=If a custom song is larger than this many megabytes, disable it.

# MenuTimer Options
MenuTimer=When 'On', certain screens have a time limit, which you can set below.\n\nWhen 'Off', these values are ignored, and you may spend as much time on each screen as you need.
ScreenSelectMusicMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenSelectMusic.
ScreenSelectMusicCasualMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenSelectMusic when in 'Casual' mode.
ScreenPlayerOptionsMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenPlayerOptions.
ScreenEvaluationMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenEvaluation.
ScreenEvaluationSummaryMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenEvaluationSummary.
ScreenNameEntryMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenNameEntry.

# Advanced Options
AllowW1=Enable or disable fantastic judgments.\n\n• Never - No fantastics, at all, ever.\n\n• Courses Only - Fantastics are only possible during courses (nonstop, oni, etc.).\n\n• Always - Fantastics are possible in normal gameplay as well as in courses.
DefaultFailType=• Immediate - Ends gameplay when all players run out of life.\n\n• ImmediateContinue - Fails players when they run out of life, but allows gameplay to continue.\n\n• EndOfSong - Evaluates whether a player passes or fails at the end of the song.\n\n• Off - Disables fail.
PercentageScoring=In other themes, this may impact whether dance points or percent scores are displayed.\n\nIn Simply Love, percent scores are always shown, but this setting still impacts how high scores get ranked relative to one another.\n\nYou want this setting 'On'.
UseUnlockSystem=Enable or disable StepMania's unlock sytem.\n\nSimply Love does not support the unlock system, and I don't know of any other theme that does.
AllowExtraStage=When enabled (and Event Mode is off), this allows players to earn extra stages after completing certain requirements.\n\nThis presumably impacts other themes, but has no bearing on Simply Love.
HiddenSongs=Simfiles with #SELECTABLE:NO; will not appear in the MusicWheel, but might be accessible via specific courses.\n\nLeave this 'Off' to always display all songs.
EasterEggs=Enable or disable some secret surprises a theme author may or may not have embedded in the theme.

[RecommendedOptionExplanations]
# Simply Love Options
Recommended=Recommended
AutoStyle='None' is the only appropriate setting for public machines.
DefaultGameMode='Casual' is probably the most appropriate for public machines.
TimingWindowAdd=It should be 0 for all modern input devices including the PIUIO, but some people claim that 0.0015 "feels" more like stock ITG, whatever that means.
AllowFailingOutOfSet=This should be 'No' unless you are a mean dude that wants to cycle people through games as quickly as possible.
MusicWheelStyle='IIDX' allows faster navigation of the MusicWheel.
MusicWheelSpeed='Plaid' is as fast as the MusicWheel will scroll.

AllowScreenSelectColor=This screen often confuses novice players, so you may wish to disable it for public machines.
AllowScreenSelectProfile=This should be 'No' for public machines.
AllowDanceSolo=This should be 'No' unless you have a 6-panel dance pad.
CasualMaxMeter=10 is about right for most public machines.
nice=This is probably best left 'Off' for public machines.
VerboseSongFolder=This should be set to "No" for public machines if you are concerned about questionable content in directory names.
UseImageCache=There is no need to turn this on if you never use Casual Mode.

# Appearance Options
ShowLyrics=Hide
ShowBanners=On

HighResolutionTextures=Auto
TextureColorDepth=32bit
SmoothLines='Off' actually looks nicer.
DelayedTextureDelete=On

# USB Profile CustomSongs Options
CustomSongsMaxSeconds=For public machines, you should set this to correspond with the 2-round cutoff under Arcade Options.\n\nIf a 1-round song can be 2:30, you should set this to 150.
