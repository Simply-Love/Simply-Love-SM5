# now we get into the longer explanations of options

[OptionExplanations]
# Top-level Service menu items
SystemOptions=Adust high-level settings like game type, theme, language, and more.
Key Joy Mappings=Map keyboard keys, panels, menu buttons, etc. to game functions.
Test Input=Test your dance pad/controller and menu buttons.\n\nIf one of your buttons is not mapped to a game function, it will appear here as "not mapped".
InputOptions=Adjust input options such as joystick automapping, dedicated menu buttons, and input debounce.
GraphicsSoundOptions=Change screen aspect ratio, resolution, graphics quality, and miscellaneous sound options.
VisualOptions=Change the way lyrics, backgrounds, etc. are displayed during gameplay; adjust overscan.
ArcadeOptions=Change options typically associated with arcade games.
AdvancedOptions=Adjust advanced settings for difficulty scaling, default fail type, song deletion, and more.
MenuTimerOptions=Turn the MenuTimer On or Off and set the MenuTimer values for various screens.
USBProfileOptions=Adjust settings related to USB Profiles, including loading custom songs from USB sticks.
Profiles=Create, edit, and manage player profiles that are stored on this computer.\n\nYou'll need a keyboard to use this screen.
ThemeOptions=Adjust settings that only apply to this Simply Love theme.
AcknowledgmentsMenu=View acknowledgments and credits for Simply Love, StepMania, and more.
Clear Credits=Reset coin credits to 0.


# SystemOptions
Game=Change the current game type.\n\n• dance is 4-panel (DDR and ITG).\n• pump is 5-panel (Pump It Up).\n• techno is 8-panel (TechnoMotion).\n\npara and kb7 are not 100% supported in Simply Love but should be playable.\n\nbeat, kickbox, and lights are not playable in Simply Love.
Theme=Change the look and feel of StepMania.\n\nThemes often extend the base functionality of SM5 in unique ways.
Language=Choose your language.\nSimply Love officially supports:\n\n• English\n• Español\n• Français\n• Italiano\n• 日本語\n• Deutsch\n• Português Brasileiro (pt-br)\n\nOther languages may be better supported in other themes.
Announcer=Choose a gameplay announcer from this list of packs you have installed.
DefaultNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin to use when playing.\n\nThis can be changed by players if they wish in the Player Options menu prior to gameplay.
EditorNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin for Edit Mode.

# Visual Options
AppearanceOptions=Change the way things are displayed during gameplay (lyrics, backgrounds, etc.).
Set BG Fit Mode=Adjust how StepMania will display (scale, crop, etc.) backgrounds during gameplay.
Overscan Correction=Use this to adjust for overscan that might occur with your display.\n\nYou'll need a keyboard to use this screen.

# Graphics/Sound Options
VideoRenderer=Choose a rendering backend.  Depending on your OS, "opengl" may be the only option available here.\n\nd3d (Windows only) does not support some visual effects.  Many "mod charts" (for example, content from TaroNuke) are visually unplayable when using d3d.\n\nYou will need to restart SM5 if you change this for it to take effect.
TextureColorDepth=Choose the color depth of textures.\n\n32-bit textures support a full range of colors.\n\n16-bit textures require less RAM but you may see "color banding" where smooth gradients of color should be.\n\nSwitching this setting to "16bit" may be helpful for older/embedded PCs with limited RAM (2GB or less).
SmoothLines=Toggle whether certain theme components are rendered with antialiased lines.
FastNoteRendering=If enabled, the z buffer is not cleared after every note.  This causes 3D noteskins to collide, but substantially improves performance in gameplay.
ShowStats=Display performance statistics in the upper right corner of the screen and show frame skips in the lower right.\n\nFPS = frames per second\nVPF = vertices per frame\n\nA high VPF count indicates that the theme is drawing complex things and requires better hardware (or better programming) to maintain a steady FPS.\n\nThis feature can be toggled at any time by pressing F3+6.
GlobalOffsetSeconds=Set the audio offset in milliseconds.\n\nNegative values cause the audio to be played earlier (late arrows), positive values cause audio playback to be late (early arrows).
VisualDelaySeconds=Subtract or add this many milliseconds of visual delay to gameplay.\n\nNegative values can be used to compensate for an LCD TV with a lot of "lag" or latency.
AttractSoundFrequency=Set to 'Always' to play sounds every time during StepMania's attract sequence.\n\nSet to '2 Times' to play sounds every other attract sequence.\n\nSet to 'Never' if you are an arcade attendent slowly losing your sanity to the unending noise engulfing you.\n\nSimply Love does not have any attract sequence sounds, but this setting may impact other themes.

# Appearance Options
ShowNativeLanguage=Choose between displaying song titles in their native language or transliterating them when possible.\n\nThis only affects songs where the stepartist provided both #TITLE and #TITLETRANSLIT information.\n\nPressing F9 on a keyboard during Select Music will toggle this setting.
ShowLyrics=Toggle the display of song lyrics during gameplay if they are available.\n\nLyrics can be provided on a per-song basis by using an .lrc file.
ShowBanners=Toggle the display of song banners during Select Music if they are available.
BGBrightness=Control how bright the background appears during gameplay. Lower values result in a darker background.\n\n0% BG Brightness will skip any scripted BGCHANGES in the simfile, so Gameplay might load more quickly.\n\nFGCHANGES, commonly used in scripted "mod" files, are not impacted by this setting.
RandomBackgroundMode=• Off - Display the background(s) specified by the current song.\n\n• Random Animations – Show randomly selected items from the BGAnimations folder during gameplay.\n\n• Random Movies - Show randomly selected items in the RandomMovies folder during gameplay.
NumBackgrounds=Choose the number of random backgrounds that will cycle per song.\n\nIf Random Gameplay Backgrounds is 'Off', this has no effect.
Center1Player=Turn this option 'On' to center the notefield during gameplay when only one player is active.
ShowDancingCharacters=If you have dancing characters installed, players can choose one from the third PlayerOptions menu in Simply Love.\n\nOther themes may use the "Select" choice to show a Character Select screen, but Simply Love does not.\n\nIf you do not have dancing characters installed, this setting will have no impact in any theme.

# Arcade Options
EventMode=• Off - Play a specific number of songs per game.\n\n• On - Play as many songs as you want per game.  Play all day if you want; I'm not your mom. 🤷
CoinMode=• Home - Options are shown on the Title screen.\n\n• Pay - Title screen choices are hidden; players must insert credits before playing. Pay mode is only possible when Event Mode is "Off."\n\n• Free Play - Title screen choices are hidden; no credits required to play.
CoinsPerCredit=Specify how many coins are needed for one credit.\n\nThis setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.
Premium=• 'Off' means one player can play with one credit\n\nThe remaining two options are surprisingly self-explanatory.\n\nThis setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.
SongsPerPlay=This limits the number of songs per game when Event Mode is set to 'Off'.\n\nYou can allow multiple games to be chained (and limited) with additional credits in Simply Love Options.
Long Time=This is the length at which a song counts as two rounds.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as two rounds.
Marathon Time=This is the length at which a song counts as three rounds.\n\nIf Songs Per Play is set to 2, any song that counts as three rounds will not appear as a choice.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as three rounds.
AllowMultipleHighScoreWithSameName=Setting this to 'Off' will prevent a single player from dominating the machine's HighScore list for a given stepchart, helpful for machines where multiple people play.\n\nIt does not limit individual profiles (local or USB) from saving multiple HighScores per stepchart.
ComboContinuesBetweenSongs=If 'Off', the combo will reset to 0 between each song.\n\nIf 'On', a profile's combo will carry across multiple songs and games until broken during gameplay.
Disqualification=If turned off, players cannot be disqualified from earning high scores.\n\nIf enabled, certain conditions (CMod on charts with speed changes, disabling attacks on charts with attacks, etc.) will disqualify players from earning high scores.


# Input Options
OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons=• Use Gameplay Buttons - Navigate through the game using your dance pad.\n\n• Only Dedicated Buttons - Navigate through the game using dedicated menu buttons, presumably on an arcade cabinet.\n\nPlease ensure your menu buttons are mapped before changing this setting, otherwise you might get stuck.
ThreeKeyNavigation=Enable this if you only have three MenuButtons per player (e.g. a traditional DDR arcade cabinet).  Some UI elements will change to reflect this.\n\nWith this enabled, you can save screenshots in Simply Love at Evaluation by simultaneously pressing &MENULEFT; and &MENURIGHT;.
ArcadeOptionsNavigation=This impacts how option menus are navigated.\n\n• StepMania Style - &START; button moves to end.\n\n• Arcade Style - &START; button moves to next option line.
InputDebounceTime=This is the time that a panel takes to de-press after you step on it.\n\nA small debounce time can help prevent vibrations that normally occur from accidentally registering as extra steps.\n\nValues larger than 50ms can be prohibitively large and cause real steps to be missed.
AxisFix=Set this to "On" if you use a USB adapter to connect your dance pad and certain jumps (for example, Up-Down jumps, Left-Right jumps, etc.) always register as "Miss".  This may fix the issue.

# Simply Love Options
AutoStyle=Set this if you ALWAYS play a certain style and want to get to gameplay as fast as possible.\n\nSet this to "None" if you want to choose a style like "1 Player" or "2 Players" for each new game cycle.
DefaultGameMode=Set the starting position of the cursor when selecting a GameMode.\n\nNote that this does not skip the screen, it just changes the starting choice.
AllowFailingOutOfSet=If 'Yes' players can potentially fail out of a set early.  If 'No' players will always be able to play all their songs.\n\nThis has no impact in Event Mode.
NumberOfContinuesAllowed=Allow players to chain multiple games together by entering extra credits. Set this to 0 if you want to disable it.\n\nThis feature only applies to Pay Mode, because credits only exist in Pay Mode.
MusicWheelSpeed=Change the speed at which the MusicWheel will scroll through content.\n\nA faster MusicWheel is especially helpful when the MenuTimer is enabled.

AllowScreenSelectProfile=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Profile screen.\n\nThe Select Profile screen can be helpful if you have multiple local profiles.
AllowScreenSelectColor=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Color screen.\n\nNote that Rainbow Mode disables the Select Color screen by default.
AllowScreenEvalSummary=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Evaluation Summary screen.
AllowScreenNameEntry=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Name Entry screen.\n\nThe Name Entry screen is always skipped in Casual mode, regardless of this setting.
AllowScreenGameOver=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Game Over screen.

MusicWheelStyle=Set this to 'IIDX' if you want the MusicWheel to hide other, inactive song groups when actively browsing one.
AllowDanceSolo=Set this to 'Yes' if you want to enable Solo as a choice so you can play the handful of ⬅↖⬇⬆↗➡ stepcharts in:\n\n• Solo Bass Mix\n• Solo 2000\n• Solo 4th Mix\n• foonmix\n• Solo Doubles 🤫\n\nThis only impacts 'Dance' game mode.
HideStockNoteSkins=Set this to 'Hide' if you want to hide all NoteSkins that come with SM5 from the modifier menu.

nice=This setting will search for instances of "69" on the Evaluation screen and let you know that they are "nice." 👌

ShowGradesInMusicWheel=Show or hide letter grades for each song you've played within the MusicWheel.\n\nPlease note that you'll need to be using a profile (local or USB) for this to work.
CasualMaxMeter=Charts harder than this will be filtered out of Casual Mode.
VisualStyle=Choose the visual icon/emblem for this theme.\n\nEach visual style within Simply Love has unique graphics and background music.
RainbowMode=Turn Rainbow Mode on or off.\n\nRainbow Mode disables ScreenSelectColor by default.
WriteCustomScores=This setting will enable the writing of custom scores files. They are stored in your profile directory. Scores are not stored for guest accounts.\n\nCustom score files can be uploaded to the simply.training website to track your personal progress.
UseImageCache=Casual Mode will run more smoothly with the ImageCache system on, but StepMania will use a LOT more RAM as a consequence. It is recommended that you have at least 8GB of RAM to use the ImageCache system.\n\nYou will need to restart StepMania after turning this setting on for it to take effect.

# USB MemoryCard Options
MemoryCards=Allow players to save preferences and personal high scores to USB drives.\n\nNote that you must configure your computer's OS (outside of StepMania) to mount USB drives a specific way first for this to work.\n\nConsult the Wiki on StepMania's GitHub for detailed instructions about this.\n\ngithub.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki
CustomSongsEnable=Allow custom songs to be loaded from USB profiles.
CustomSongsMaxCount=Use this to limit the number of songs that will be loaded from a given USB profile.
CustomSongsLoadTimeout=If loading a song from a USB takes more seconds than this, cancel it and make the player choose a different song.
CustomSongsMaxSeconds=If a song from a USB profile is longer than this many minutes and seconds, it will not appear as a selectable song.
CustomSongsMaxMegabytes=If a song from a USB profile is larger than this file size, it will not appear as a selectable song.

# MenuTimer Options
MenuTimer=When 'On', certain screens have a time limit, which you can set below.\n\nWhen 'Off', these values are ignored, and you may spend as much time on each screen as you need.
ScreenSelectMusicMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenSelectMusic.
ScreenSelectMusicCasualMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenSelectMusic when in 'Casual' mode.
ScreenPlayerOptionsMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenPlayerOptions.
ScreenEvaluationMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenEvaluation.
ScreenEvaluationSummaryMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenEvaluationSummary.
ScreenNameEntryMenuTimer=Set the MenuTimer value for ScreenNameEntry.

# Advanced Options
AllowW1=Enable or disable fantastic judgments.\n\n• Never - No fantastics, at all, ever.\n\n• Courses Only - Fantastics are only possible during courses (nonstop, oni, etc.).\n\n• Always - Fantastics are possible in normal gameplay as well as in courses.
DefaultFailType=• Immediate - Ends gameplay when all players run out of life.\n\n• ImmediateContinue - Fails players when they run out of life, but allows gameplay to continue.\n\n• EndOfSong - Evaluates whether a player passes or fails at the end of the song.\n\n• Off - Disables fail.
PercentageScoring=In other themes, this may impact whether dance points or percent scores are displayed.\n\nIn Simply Love, percent scores are always shown, but this setting still impacts how high scores get ranked relative to one another.\n\nYou want this setting 'On'.
UseUnlockSystem=Enable or disable StepMania's unlock system.\n\nSimply Love does not support the unlock system, and I don't know of any other theme that does.
AllowExtraStage=When enabled (and Event Mode is off), this allows players to earn extra stages after completing certain requirements.\n\nThis presumably impacts other themes, but has no bearing on Simply Love.
HiddenSongs=Simfiles with #SELECTABLE:NO; will not appear in the MusicWheel, but might be accessible via specific courses.\n\nLeave this 'Off' to always display all songs.
EasterEggs=Enable or disable some secret surprises a theme author may or may not have embedded in the theme.
AllowSongDeletion=Allow players to permanently delete songs from the computer by pressing Control + Backspace when browsing the MusicWheel.
