-- Here's where the "magic" for visual previews in OptionRows happens.  D:
--
-- This feels pretty hackish.  But it works.  And is less work than writing my own options
-- system in pure Lua.
--
-- ScreenPlayerOptions overlay.lua has all the necessary NoteSkin actors, Judgment Font
-- actors, and Combo Font actors loaded but not showing.  That asset-loading code is over
-- in ./BGAnimations/ScreenPlayerOptions overlay/OptionRowPreviews/
--
-- Here, we're adding one ActorProxy per-player per-OptionRow and using them to draw
-- the NoteSkin, Judgment Font, Combo Font, etc. assets loaded elsewhere.  These
-- ActorProxies are what the player sees in each OptionRow.
--
------ WHAT DO ACTORPROXIES DO?
-- Out of the box, ActorProxies don't do or show anything, but they can be used to draw what
-- some other actor is already drawing.  This has the effect of visually duplicating one
-- actor into two (the actor + the ActorProxy).
--
-- ActorProxy actors are typically handy in scripted simfiles, where they can be used to
-- visually duplicate the entire Player ActorFrame or the LifeMeter or some other visual
-- element of ScreenGameplay that is defined outside the context of the simfile scripting.
--
-- From the Lua of a scripted simfile, you can't say "I want there to be five copies of the
-- playfield when the screen initializes" because by the time your simfile's Lua is
-- evaluated, the screen has already initialized and the Actors are in place.  ActorProxies
-- are generic.  You pass them a reference to an already-existing actor via SetTarget()
-- and they'll draw it.
--
-- As noted, this is more obviously handy in scripted simfiles.  In theming, if you need
-- two of some actor, you can usually just write your own theme code so that there are two
-- of that Actor.
--
------ WHAT ARE OPTIONROWS?
-- ScreenPlayerOptions uses the "OptionRow" system provided by the StepMania engine.  It's
-- a generic framework that allows players to scroll between multiple rows where each row has
-- multiple things to choose from.
--
------ HOW ARE OPTIONROWS LIMITED?
-- The OptionRow system only supports text as choices.  Not visual representations of
-- NoteSkins, not judgment graphic textures. Just text.  I really like being able to *show*
-- players what the NoteSkin looks like instead of just telling the name of it, but OptionRows
-- can only show text.
--
------ WHY USE OPTIONROWS IF THEY'RE SO LIMITED?
-- I like OptionRows because, as a system, it manages nearly all input handling out of the box,
-- including 3Key input (traditional DDR arcade cabs), 4Key input(ITG dedicabs), keyboard
-- input, etc. Handling input is complicated and tedious at best.
-- See ScreenSelectMusicCasual if you want an example.
--
------ HOW ARE YOU USING ACTORPROXIES TO DRAW VISUALS IN OPTIONROWS?
-- So, I stuffed one ActorProxy per-player into each OptionRow Frame and devised a hackish
-- system to have them draw NoteSkins in the NoteSkin row, and judgment textures in the
-- Judgment Font row, and etc.
--
-- Note that because this file (OptionRow Frame.lua) is generic and used to define the
-- background of *every* OptionRow, the PlayerOptions screen ends up getting a lot of
-- ActorProxies that it doesn't actually need.  The frame for the SpeedMod row has these
-- ActorProxies though it doesn't use them.  As does the SpeedModType.  As does the
-- background filter.  Etc.
--
-- I can't only add ActorProxies to rows that need them because this file is generic
-- and supposed to be used to tell StepMania what to make *all* OptionRows look like.
-- Once the screen and each OptionRow are initialized (OnCommand), it is possible to check
-- what this Frame's parent OptionRow's name is and, from there, call hibernate(math.huge)
-- on the ActorProxies we don't need.
--
-- If the parent OptionRow's name is "NoteSkin" or "JudgmentGraphic" or "ComboFont", we leave
-- it drawing and allow different Message commands broadcast from ./Scripts/SL-PlayerOptions.lua
-- to make this generic ActorProxy look like a NoteSkin or a JudgementGraphic or a ComboFont.
--
------ CONCLUSION
-- It's a hack, but it works.
--
-- It's less effort than writing my own options menu system in Lua.
-- It's also less effort than extending the engine's OptionRow system to handle more than text.
--
-- If you think this system/code is Bad and in need of a proper fix â€” I agree!  Please put
-- in the hours to implement a proper fix and the community will surely be better for it. :)
