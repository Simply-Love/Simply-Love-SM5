-- in players getting stuck within the theme.

-- If the player is in the operator menu and tries to switch to, say, kickbox
-- the engine will change the game, the theme will reload, this screen will load,
-- we'll detect that kickbox isn't supported, and bounce them right back to choosing a different game.

-- The same thing basically happens if StepMania starts up in an unsupported game
-- or if the player switches into Simply Love from another theme in an unsupported game.
