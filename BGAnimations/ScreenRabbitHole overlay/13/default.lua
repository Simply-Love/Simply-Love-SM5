-- There are many ways I could describe the differences between other places I've
-- lived and Pittsburgh, but the one that impacts me the most is the number of
-- homeless people I observe in a given day.
--
-- There's a routine to most of it. There are specific locations I expect to see
-- specific people – outside the Forbes Ave. McDonald's, or under the Birmingham
-- bridge – and I expect them to hold up a cup as I pass by and ask if I can spare
-- "a buck or three? I just need to get home. Three dollars is all I need for the bus."
--
-- The stories they don't tell me – the ones I see in their sunburn and torn clothing –
-- tug at my heart, and I carry one dollar bills with me everywhere, going through
-- twenty-five or so a week.
--
-- There is one homeless man who half-reclines outside of the local Rite Aid every day,
-- in sun and rain and snow alike. He looks sixty given his beard and facial creases,
-- but is probably more like fifty. He has a cup for money, but I've never seen him say
-- anything to anyone or even acknowledge a passerby's existence. When I pass by him,
-- his stare is fixed calmly on a point slightly above the horizon, his lips forming a
-- half-smile. I often wonder what occupies his mind.
--
-- A small, makeshift cardboard sign is typically in front of him with a handwritten
-- message that changes every few days. Last week it said something about North Korea.
-- Yesterday it read "President Trump wants to feed our children to crocodiles."
--
-- Today, as I approached from a block away, I could see him in his expected position –
-- back leaning against Rite Aid's brick exterior, legs inside his sleeping bag, left
-- hip and elbow supporting him against the concrete sidewalk. A young mother and her
-- four-year-old daughter were approaching from the opposite direction. Their clasped
-- hands were swinging blithely back and forth and I slowed my pace to let them pass
-- the homeless man first.
--
-- At that moment, a passing bus discharged its air brake pressure in a loud, pneumatic
-- tsssssss, causing the young girl to jump and exclaim in surprise. Her mother looked
-- down and asked, "are you okay?"
--
-- The girl was already fine; she smiled and giggled, "it was loud!"
--
-- "Yeah, it caught you off-guard, didn't it?" her mother responded, smiling as well.
--
-- From a quarter block away, I observed the homeless man's gaze turn to meet the mother
-- and daughter and their exchange, a pure smile breaking across his lips.
