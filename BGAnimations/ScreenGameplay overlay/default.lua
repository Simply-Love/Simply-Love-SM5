-- There's a lot of Lua in ./BGAnimations/ScreenGameplay overlay
--    and a LOT of Lua in ./BGAnimations/ScreenGameplay underlay
--
-- I'm using files in overlay for logic that *does* stuff without
-- directly drawing any new actors to the screen.
--
-- I've tried to title each file helpfully and partition the logic
-- found in each accordingly. Inline comments in each should provide
-- insight into the objective of each file.
--
-- Def.Actor will be used for each underlay file because I still
-- need some way to listen for events broadcast by the engine.
--
-- I'm using files in Gameplay's underlay for actors that get drawn
-- to the screen and visible to the player.  You can poke around in
-- those files to learn more.
