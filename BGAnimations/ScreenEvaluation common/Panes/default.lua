	--
	-- This approach (loading two of each Pane, even in single) was easier for me to write
	-- InputHandling for.  An approach I considered was loading one of each pane and then
	-- moving the panes around (between left and right sides of ScreenEval) via InputHandling.
	-- That was less computional work (not loading everything twice), but it was more work
	-- for my milquetoast mind. (-quietly)
	--
	-- Some of the Panes (QR code, timing histogram) contain expensive computation that can
	-- delay ScreenEvaluation's load time, *especially* when performed twice.  If only one
	-- player is joined, it's wasteful to do these identical calculations twice.
	--
	-- So, use ComputedData as a table local to this file (it won't persist past ScreenEvaluation)
	-- and pass it into Pane sub-files as a "reference" to achieve pointer-like behavior within
	-- the scoping contexts that exist within this file within ScreenEvaluation.  In this way, we can
	-- check if some expensive calculations have already been run, and refer to the ComputedData
	-- table to get the results.
