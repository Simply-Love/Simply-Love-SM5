-- this CodeMessage is defined in metrics.ini under [ScreenEvaluation]
-- (Using a lua-based InputCallback would also have worked here, but this is fewer lines of code.)

		-- some song titles have slashes in them, which is interpreted as a folder in the path as
		-- screenshot is saved. we'll substitute those slashes with underscores to prevent this.

		-- arg3 is a boolean for whther to have CRYPTMAN use the machine's private key to sign the screenshot
		--      (there is currently no online system in place that I know that would benefit from that^)
		-- arg4 is an optional string to prefix the filename with
		-- arg5 is an optional string to append to the end of the filename
		--
		-- first return value is boolean indicating success/failure to write to disk

		--     (directory + filename) if write to disk was successful

-- second, animate a texture (that looks like a screenshot) to visually signify to the player that the screenshot was saved
--
-- the code here is only half of what's needed for this screen's ScreenShot animation.
--
-- The texture that is loaded into this Sprite actor is created via an
-- ActorFrameTexture in ./BGAnimations/ScreenEvaluationStage background.lua
-- (From on my non-exhaustive testing, having the ActorFrameTexture here in
-- this file would crash StepMania, but it's been a while since I've checked.)
--
-- The AFT there contains an ActorProxy of the entire Screen object, which listens
-- for "ScreenshotCurrentScreen" to be broadcast via MESSAGEMAN.  When that message is
-- broadcast from this file, the ActorProxy there queues a command causing the AFT
-- to become visible for a moment, render, and then go back to being not-drawn.
--
-- Even though the AFT is no longer drawing to the screen, its rendered texture is still
-- in memory.  We put a reference to that texture in the global SL table, so that we can
-- then retrieve it here, assign it to this Sprite, and tween it to the bottom of the screen.
