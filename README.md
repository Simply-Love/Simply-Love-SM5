Simply Love (StepMania 5)
======================

This is a recreation of hurtpiggypig's Simply Love SM3.95 theme made to now run in StepMania 5.

I use the word "recreation" (as opposed to "port") because virtually no code was brought over from the SM3.95 counterpart.  My general process was to visually inspect the original SM3.95 theme, and recreate it screen by screen in SM5.

For information on the original StepMania 3.95 version of Simply Love, check here:

TODO:

**MISSING FEATURES**

* ghost data
* timed sets
* surround lifebar for ScreenGameplay

**NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT**

* set long/marathon cutoff lengths via Operator Menu like oITG
* set per-screen MenuTimers via Operator Menu
* ~~reimplement Screen Resolution and Aspect Ratio OptionRows to make more sense~~ this is not going to happen short of an engine overhaul

**KNOWN BUGS**

* Custom DifficultyList breaks with certain combinations of edits
* ~~CourseMode MusicWheel lags~~ this is engine-side


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
----------------

* [hurtpiggypig](http://www.shirtpiggypig.com/) -- Lara designed the original Simply Love theme for StepMania 3.95.
* [djpohly](https://github.com/djpohly) -- Devin was a constant source of knowledge and help during the months I spent porting this.
* [sigatrev](https://github.com/sigatrev) -- Matt helped Lara implement some of the more technical aspects of the original theme and was always available to respond to my questions.
* [freem](https://github.com/freem) -- I used AJ's StepMania 5 theme, [Moonlight](http://ssc.ajworld.net/?p=moonlight), as the foundation/starting point for this port.  While virtually none of Moonlight is left in Simply Love at this point, it helped immensely in providing the examples I needed when getting started.
* [kyzentun](https://github.com/kyzentun) -- kyzentun answered many of my theming questions on IRC and even went out of his way to fix source-related issues that helped me out along my way.
* the SM5 dev-team and IRC-frequenters -- Theming in SM5 is significantly easier than it is in 3.95.  Thank you, for that.  Thank you, shakesoda, Midiman, wolfman2000, et al!
