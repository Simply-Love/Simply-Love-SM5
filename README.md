======================

======================

This is a recreation of hurtpiggypig's Simply Love SM3.95 theme made to now run in StepMania 5.

I use the word "recreation" (as opposed to "port") because virtually no code was brought over from the SM3.95 counterpart.  My general process was to visually inspect the original SM3.95 theme, and recreate it screen by screen in SM5.

For information on the original StepMania 3.95 version of Simply Love, check here:

Requirements:
-------------
You'll need to be running [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12) to use this theme.  Older versions of StepMania are not compatible.

If you are having trouble installing StepMania or getting it to run on your computer, please refer to StepMania's [FAQ](http://www.stepmania.com/faq/) and see [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania-site/issues/64).

Installation
--------------
To install this theme, unzip it and move the resulting directory inside the *Themes* folder in your [StepMania user data directory](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/User-Data-Locations).  The resulting directory structure should [look like this](http://www.personal.psu.edu/djg270/sites/sm5/?open=11-4).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
----------------

* [hurtpiggypig](http://www.shirtpiggypig.com/) -- Lara designed the original Simply Love theme for StepMania 3.95.
* [djpohly](https://github.com/djpohly) -- Devin was a constant source of knowledge and help during the months I spent porting this.
* [sigatrev](https://github.com/sigatrev) -- Matt helped Lara implement some of the more technical aspects of the original theme and was always available to respond to my questions.
* [freem](https://github.com/freem) -- I used AJ's StepMania 5 theme, [Moonlight](http://ssc.ajworld.net/?p=moonlight), as the foundation/starting point for this port.  While virtually none of Moonlight is left in Simply Love at this point, it helped immensely in providing the examples I needed when getting started.
* [kyzentun](https://github.com/kyzentun) -- kyzentun answered many of my theming questions on IRC and even went out of his way to fix source-related issues that helped me out along my way.
* the SM5 dev-team and IRC-frequenters -- Theming in SM5 is significantly easier than it is in 3.95.  Thank you, for that.  Thank you, shakesoda, Midiman, wolfman2000, et al!
