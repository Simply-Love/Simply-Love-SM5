# About
Maintaining my own fork of [Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5) that contains theme changes that I personally use. The primary change is outputting song info to a text file for use as a song ticker through an OBS text source, but I may look into other minor theme changes.


## Supported Versions of StepMania

Simply Love is compatible with current releases from the official StepMania project.

**Compatible Releases**<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12)<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.1-b2](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2)<br>

If you are able to compile StepMania's source code yourself, the [5_1-new branch](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/tree/5_1-new/) is supported.  The wiki has [instructions for compiling](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Compiling-StepMania).

## Installing Simply Love

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Simply Love, fully delete the old Simply Love folder first.  **Do not merge the new folder into the old.**

You can download the current Simply Love release at the [Latest Release](https://github.com/quietly-turning/Simply-Love-SM5/releases/latest) page.

Full install instructions are in the [Installing Simply Love](./Other/Documentation/InstallingSimplyLove-README.md) README.
