## About

Simply Love is a StepMania 5 theme for the post-ITG community.

It features a clean and simple design, offers numerous data-driven features not implemented by the StepMania 5 engine, and allows the current generation of ITG fans to breathe new life into the game they've known for over a decade.

Simply Love was originally designed and implemented for a previous version of StepMania (SM3.95) by hurtpiggypig.  For more information on that version of Simply Love, check here:

## Supported Versions of StepMania

Simply Love is compatible with current releases from the official StepMania project.

**Compatible Releases**<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12)<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.1-b2](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2)<br>
✅ [OutFox 0.4.14.1](https://projectoutfox.com/releases/0.4.14.1) and newer (preliminary support). Versions prior to that are not supported.<br>

For new installations we currently recommend installing StepMania 5.1. While
5.0.12 is officially the latest stable release of StepMania, 5.1 is widely used
and an improvement over 5.0 in almost every regard. StepMania 5.3 (Outfox) is
currently in an alpha stage of development. Check it out, though. The project
is making great progress!

If you are able to compile StepMania's source code yourself, the [5_1-new branch](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/tree/5_1-new/) is supported.  The wiki has [instructions for compiling](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Compiling-StepMania).


**Incompatible**<br>
❌ Forks of SM5 (e.g. *starworlds*)<br>
❌ Older versions of StepMania (e.g. StepMania 3.9)<br>
❌ Forks of older versions of StepMania (e.g. OpenITG, NotITG)<br>
❌ SM5.2
