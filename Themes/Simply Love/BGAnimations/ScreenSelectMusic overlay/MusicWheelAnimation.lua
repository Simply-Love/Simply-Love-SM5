-- Each MusicWheelItem has two Quads drawn in front of it, blocking it from view.
-- Each of these Quads is half the height of the MusicWheelItem, and their y-coordinates
-- are such that there is an "upper" and a "lower" Quad.
-- The upper Quad has cropbottom applied while the lower Quad has croptop applied
-- resulting in a visual effect where the MusicWheelItems appear to "grow" out of the center to full-height.

-- Since the background of this screen is Black, we can get away with drawing Black Quads on top
-- of each MusicWheelItem and it looks fine.  If the background had been visually busy, these Quads
-- would need to be Masks.
